# CS-150-Project-1---Data-Merger
Takes content of two files, one filled with Student name, lecture section and lecture activity grades, another filled with lab section and lab activity grades. Combines the content of the files to fin student final grade and letter grade and output to a single CSV file sorted in alphabetical order by lecture section.

Currently, this program is broken. An error was found in method setFinalGradePerc(), which when fixed, seems to have thrown off the final grade percentages for ALL students.
